# ONBOARDING — replicating and working in this ecosystem

For a **human** setting up a new machine, and for an **agent** arriving in
any of these repos for the first time. This is a map with procedures — every
standard it mentions is canonical somewhere else and deep-linked; if this
file and a linked file disagree, the linked file wins.

*Last verified current: 2026-07-10.*

## The ecosystem at a glance

One standards repo governs; execution repos do the work; exchanges between
them are files, not conversations.

| Repo | Role | Remote |
|---|---|---|
| **autonomous** (this repo) | Standards: doctrine, integrations policy, harness kit, governor spec, ecosystem roadmap | github.com/Lifted-Truck/autonomous |
| **agent-knowledge-loop** | The cross-project audit loop (promote-up memory) | github.com/Lifted-Truck/agent-knowledge-loop |
| **distillery** | Global memory: append-only stream + analyst + distilled pool | github.com/Lifted-Truck/distillery |
| **dispatch** | Daily progress publishing: collector → FACTS → digest → gated publish | github.com/Lifted-Truck/dispatch |
| **ai-integration-methodology** | The human-epistemics sibling: the collaboration methodology + consulting offering | github.com/Lifted-Truck/ai-integration-methodology |

Cross-repo sequencing: [ROADMAP.md → Ecosystem tracks](ROADMAP.md).
The design and its evidence: [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md), [research/](research/).
The full orientation to layers/protocols/cycles: [README.md](README.md).

## Part 1 — As a human

### Setting up a new machine

1. **Clone the standards repo to the canonical path** (the doctrine imports
   assume it):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lifted-Truck/autonomous.git ~/Documents/Claude/autonomous
   ```
2. **Wire the global CLAUDE.md** — follow
   [doctrine/INSTALL-GLOBAL.md](doctrine/INSTALL-GLOBAL.md) (paste one block,
   verify a fresh session sees the doctrine). Machine-local sections of your
   global file stay machine-local; never copy them between machines.
3. **Clone the audit loop:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lifted-Truck/agent-knowledge-loop.git ~/Documents/Claude/agent-knowledge-loop
   ```
4. **Clone the execution tracks:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lifted-Truck/distillery.git ~/Documents/Claude/distillery
   git clone https://github.com/Lifted-Truck/dispatch.git   ~/Documents/Claude/dispatch
   ```
5. **Optional — the weekly audit-loop cron.** Copy
   `agent-knowledge-loop/audit-loop.config.example` →
   `audit-loop.config` (same dir, git-ignored, machine-local scopes), then:
   ```
   0 9 * * 0 $HOME/Documents/Claude/agent-knowledge-loop/audit-loop.sh >> $HOME/Documents/Claude/audit-loop.cron.log 2>&1
   ```
   It is propose-only by design — it never mutates shared stores.
6. **Verify:** start a fresh Claude Code session anywhere; ask what the
   doctrine says about the AI/deterministic boundary; confirm the answer
   matches [doctrine/DOCTRINE.md](doctrine/DOCTRINE.md).

### Working day-to-day

- **You are the ratifier.** The system is built so agents propose and you
  decide at named gates: project manifests (phase-0 gates), integration
  briefs' responses, memory promotions (audit-run proposals), doctrine
  changes (landscape-audit proposals), and anything published or
  irreversible. Saying *no* is cheap and expected.
- **Where things are decided:** each repo's ROADMAP.md is its single source
  of direction; DECISIONS.md is the append-only record. If you decide
  something in conversation, it isn't decided until it's in those files.
- **Starting a new project:** ask an agent to run the spin-up survey
  ([kit/README.md](kit/README.md) — 9 questions) and scaffold from your
  answers. The architecture menu is question 2; a fleet is never the default.
- **Asking one project for something another owns:** that's an integrations
  brief, not a chat request — see Part 2's cross-repo section; the mechanics
  are identical for humans.

## Part 2 — As an agent

### Your first ten minutes in any repo here

Read, in order: `README.md` (what this is) → `ROADMAP.md` (what's next and
what proves it done) → `DECISIONS.md` (what's already settled — do not
re-litigate) → `CLAUDE.md` (your charter; §Domain holds the invariants a
critic will check you against) → `INDEX.md` if present (pull only matching
LIBRARY lessons). Then run `./verify report` to see the oracle's last state.

### Rules of residency (condensed; canonical sources linked)

1. **ROADMAP.md outranks everything**, including the conversation. Ambiguous
   or missing acceptance criteria? Surfacing that gap IS the deliverable —
   grounded refusal is a success class ([harness charter](harness/CLAUDE.md)).
2. **Oracle discipline** ([README §3](README.md)): `./verify fast` after any
   change set, `full` before closing an item; report output verbatim; red
   halts forward work; never weaken a gate without a recorded human decision.
   Passing ≠ done — done = green + acceptance criteria + trace written.
3. **Writes stay home** ([doctrine/INTEGRATIONS.md](doctrine/INTEGRATIONS.md)):
   never commit to a repo you're not resident in. One exception: filing
   exchange files in a provider's `integrations/<your-project>/` slot.
4. **Memory loop duty**: every project runs the knowledge loop
   ([README §4a](README.md)) — ORIENT before acting, REFLECT before ending;
   the write gate is strict (evidence + falsifier, prefer not writing over
   writing unverified; if nothing qualifies, write nothing).
5. **Provenance**: nontrivial claims cite file/line, a verify run, or a
   ROADMAP entry; merged changes get a `traces/` entry.
6. **Human gates**: deleting files, public-interface changes, editing
   `./verify`, new dependencies, git beyond add/commit, anything §Domain
   protects, anything outward-facing (publishing, remote pushes to new
   places) — stop and ask.
7. **Review beats are visual-first** ([doctrine](doctrine/DOCTRINE.md)):
   at any gate — phase close, ratification request, PR — lead with a visual
   presentation sufficient to evaluate the work without reading code; the
   diff is the fallback, never the ask.
8. **Respect the AI/deterministic boundary**: if you find yourself doing
   scheduling, metrics, validation, or collection "by judgment," stop — that
   belongs in code you should write instead.

### Working across repos (the integrations protocol, quickstart)

Need something from another project? File a brief at
`<provider>/integrations/<your-project>/brief.md` with frontmatter
(`id`, `status`, `ball`, `filed`, `respond-by`) — live examples:
[integrations/dispatch/brief.md](integrations/dispatch/brief.md),
[integrations/distillery/brief.md](integrations/distillery/brief.md).
The `ball:` field always names the one side that owes the next move. Never
wait blocked: ship a visibly-degraded placeholder behind the same interface
and proceed. Cross-repo changes land as two linked PRs, provider first.
Full policy: [doctrine/INTEGRATIONS.md](doctrine/INTEGRATIONS.md).

### Replicating the project structure for a NEW project (until kit v2 ships)

Shortcut: the `/spinup` command (installed per INSTALL-GLOBAL step 3) wraps
this procedure; the doctrine also instructs any session asked to "start a
new project" to land here. The procedure itself, mirroring what built
`distillery`/`dispatch` (use them as reference implementations):

1. Conduct the spin-up survey with the human ([kit/README.md](kit/README.md),
   9 questions); write answers to `project.manifest.json`, marked
   provisional until ratified.
2. Copy the harness: `autonomous/harness/.claude` → `.claude/`,
   `autonomous/harness/verify` → `./verify` (chmod +x). Implement `fast()`
   with at least a structure/manifest sanity check — a green-from-day-zero
   oracle, honestly scoped, beats an aspirational red one.
3. Write `CLAUDE.md` from [harness/CLAUDE.md](harness/CLAUDE.md): the
   invariant layer verbatim, §Domain filled (what it is, stack, invariants,
   protected paths, verify targets — under ~60 lines).
4. Write `ROADMAP.md`: phase-gated, each gate an executable/checkable
   condition; open questions listed as blocking-ask-the-human.
5. Write `README.md` per the clarity standard ([doctrine/DOCTRINE.md](doctrine/DOCTRINE.md)):
   orientation without code-diving, a dated "last verified" line, status
   markers on anything unbuilt.
6. Install the knowledge loop:
   [loops/knowledge-loop/integrate-knowledge-loop.prompt.md](loops/knowledge-loop/integrate-knowledge-loop.prompt.md),
   tags from survey Q8.
7. `mkdir traces/` (+ pointer README), `.gitignore` (`.harness/`,
   `.claude/settings.local.json`), `git init -b main`, initial commit, run
   `./verify fast` — green before the first commit lands.
8. If it participates in the ecosystem: file its intake brief(s) with
   providers, and ask a resident of autonomous to register it in the
   ecosystem tracks (that's a ROADMAP edit — governor/resident-only).

### Composite projects (`/spinup --composite`) — one repo, N contract-bound modules

For a project that is one deployable made of several modules behind a shared
seam (a plugin hosting engines, an app with plugins, a monorepo of services
built together). Worked reference: `~/Documents/Claude/synthetic-worlds/Orrery`
(one VST, N sequencer engines behind an `IEngine` contract). This is the
**organ model applied intra-repo** — a territory is a subdirectory with an
enforced write boundary, NOT a separate repo. Bucket the modules together;
separate repos are only for independent products with cross-repo versioned
contracts (that's the INTEGRATIONS protocol, not this).

Differences from the standard procedure — the five moves:
1. **Promote the shared seam to "the contract."** The one document/interface
   every module imports (Orrery: `sequencer-studio-architecture.md`). Changes
   to it are contract-version events; freeze it for a build phase and gate
   edits behind a human.
2. **Root charter + one sub-charter per module territory.** Root `CLAUDE.md`
   carries the layer map + the rung path; each module's `CLAUDE.md` is lean,
   points at the root + contract, and its §Domain is that module's own spec.
3. **A `composite` manifest block** — the territory registry: `contract`,
   a `modules_dir` (Orrery: `engines/`), and one entry per territory
   (path, role, spec-or-null, prototype, status). This is the machine-readable
   source of truth for what modules exist.
4. **Record which doc wins where.** Composite projects accrete docs at
   different times (Orrery's first engine spec predated the contract); pin
   precedence in DECISIONS so no agent builds a superseded design.
5. **Rung 2→3 by default.** Prove the seam on ONE module single-threaded
   (shell + first engine), gate green, THEN parallelize the rest as organs
   (own territory + own verify). Composite structure is the strongest
   earned-rung-3 signal, but exercise the contract before trusting it.

Then, mechanically: put modules under `modules_dir/`; keep a
`modules_dir/_template/` sub-charter for intake; make `./verify` go RED on any
`modules_dir/<name>/` not registered in the manifest (the intake safety net —
nothing half-added). **Watch for contract findings during intake:** a module
needing a contract *variant* (Orrery's Kuramoto → free-transport) or a new
output kind (Torus → native pitch) is a contract-change proposal, not just a
new territory — record it in DECISIONS and gate its build on the change.

### Retrofitting an EXISTING project (catch-up scaffolding)

Shortcut: the `/retrofit` command wraps this. The greenfield procedure above
assumes an empty directory; an existing repo has value at risk and its own
conventions, so the retrofit differs in four load-bearing ways: **infer
before asking, plan before writing, append never rewrite, and never break
what works.**

1. **Gap survey (read-only).** Derive the repo's current harness status
   (the sweep's checks: CLAUDE.md, `./verify`, ROADMAP, DECISIONS,
   INDEX/LIBRARY, traces/, manifest, `.claude/` hooks+agents); detect the
   stack and existing test/lint/format commands; read the existing README,
   docs, and TODOs for implicit roadmap content. Produce a gap table:
   present / missing / present-but-nonconforming.
2. **Survey with inference.** Conduct the 9-question spin-up survey
   ([kit/README.md](kit/README.md)), but propose answers inferred from the
   code (what-is-it, stack, domain core, consumers) and ask only what code
   cannot show (architecture rung — still never defaulted — oracle-shape
   preference, lifespan/autonomy, knowledge-loop tags). Answers land in
   `project.manifest.json`, noted as a retrofit.
3. **Plan, then PAUSE for approval.** List every file to create vs modify
   before writing anything. Unlike greenfield, this pause is mandatory —
   an existing repo is someone's working state.
4. **Apply, gap by gap, non-destructively:**
   - Existing files are appended to between `<!-- MARKER -->` blocks, never
     rewritten or reordered; on any contradiction between the template and
     existing content, the existing content wins pending a human ruling.
   - `./verify` WRAPS the repo's existing test/lint commands — never
     replaces its test setup. **Red-suite honesty:** if existing tests are
     currently red, do not gate on them and do not delete them — `fast()`
     runs the currently-green subset, and the red set is recorded in
     ROADMAP as explicit debt with its own phase gate. Retrofit never
     weakens an existing check; it may only quarantine-and-record.
   - ROADMAP absorbs existing TODOs/plan docs (migrate content, leave
     pointers at the old locations); DECISIONS starts with the retrofit
     itself as entry 1 unless history makes earlier decisions certain.
   - Then as greenfield: traces/, knowledge loop (tags from survey),
     README brought to the clarity standard with a dated last-verified
     line.
5. **Verify + close.** `./verify fast` green; re-running the retrofit is a
   no-op (marker-idempotent); briefs filed if the project is a consumer or
   provider; one trace entry for the whole change; report at a review beat
   (visual-first: the before/after gap table is the artifact) with the
   manifest for ratification.

### What not to do

- Don't edit doctrine in any global CLAUDE.md — propose changes in this
  repo (versioned, reviewable).
- Don't copy canonical content into a second editable location — link it.
  Same content in two places is a bug ([README §8](README.md)).
- Don't add memory outside the loop's write gate, don't broadcast lessons
  (proliferation is the curator's targeted job), and never expose
  distillery's raw stream to a working context.
- Don't escalate the architecture rung because parallelism sounds faster —
  the burden of proof runs the other way (Decision 8).

## Replication checklist (the short version)

**Human, new machine:** clone autonomous → INSTALL-GLOBAL → clone
agent-knowledge-loop → clone tracks (needs remotes) → optional cron →
fresh-session doctrine check.

**Agent, new repo:** README → ROADMAP → DECISIONS → CLAUDE.md → INDEX →
`./verify report`; then work the top ready ROADMAP item under the rules of
residency.

**Agent, new project:** survey → manifest → harness copy → charter →
phase-gated ROADMAP → README → knowledge loop → git init + green verify →
briefs + track registration if ecosystem-facing.
