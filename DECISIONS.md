# Decisions on record (append-only)

Each entry: the decision, the alternative rejected, and why. Never rewrite
history; supersede with a new numbered entry.

1. **`autonomous/` is the canonical home for all harness infrastructure**
   (2026-07-10). Everything ad-hoc at the Claude root consolidates here or is
   pointed at from here; old locations become tombstone pointers. Rejected:
   leaving artifacts distributed with an index — drift between copies was
   already observed (audit-loop root files vs published package).
2. **Component repos stay canonical where already published** (2026-07-10).
   The audit loop's canonical home remains
   github.com/Lifted-Truck/agent-knowledge-loop (already public, newer than
   the root copies); this repo points at it. Rejected: importing it here —
   would create a second editable source of published content.
3. **Kit v2 replaces kit v1 outright** (2026-07-10, user mandate). v1 frozen
   in `archive/kit-v1/`. v2 shape: core + agent-type profiles that agents can
   scaffold for their own type (DESIGN §6). Rejected: incremental v1 updates —
   v1 is single-threaded-era and the user prefers a research-backed rebuild.
4. **Doctrine is single-sourced in `doctrine/` and imported by the global
   CLAUDE.md via `@` imports** (2026-07-10). Machine-local facts stay in the
   global file. Rejected: duplication (drifts) and bare pointers (loses
   auto-load).
5. **Integrations responsibility model: writes stay home** (2026-07-10).
   Only residents commit to a repo; cross-repo work = two linked PRs,
   provider lands first, consumer bumps pin second; exchanges carry a `ball:`
   field so exactly one side owns the next move; consumer contract tests are
   consumer-authored but resident-landed. Closes the commit/PR ownership gap
   in the Tonality-era protocol. Rejected: visiting commits (bypass the
   resident harness) and single cross-repo PRs (no such primitive exists,
   and responsibility blurs).
6. **Remote: github.com/Lifted-Truck/autonomous, currently PUBLIC**
   (2026-07-10). Visibility was the repo's state at consolidation time;
   flagged to the user — flip to private is a one-click change if desired.
7. **Research reports are preserved verbatim in `research/`** (2026-07-10),
   as the citable evidence base for kit v2's INSIGHTS and future design
   arguments. Summaries live in DESIGN.md; the reports are the source.
8. **Multi-agent is a visible option at project structuring, never the
   default** (2026-07-10, user mandate). Kit v2's scaffold opens with an
   explicit architecture menu (single thread / thread + subagents / organ
   fleet), each rung earned by project shape. Rejected: fleet-by-default —
   contradicts the token economics and the harness-outranks-head-count
   evidence.
9. **Clarity standard: every system keeps a living README** (2026-07-10,
   user mandate). Human-orientable without reading code; freshness maintained
   on a loop; staleness visible, never hidden. A possible global daily
   README-refresh agent is parked in ROADMAP deferred, not decided.
10. **Kit v2 opens with a standard spin-up survey → committed manifest →
    deterministic scaffolding** (2026-07-10, user proposal, adopted). A fixed
    repeatable question list captures project scope; answers land in
    `project.manifest.json`; deterministic code applies templates from the
    manifest. Rationale: MAST found ~42% of multi-agent failures are
    specification failures — the survey moves spec capture to the cheapest
    possible moment (before any code exists), and answers-as-data makes
    scaffolding idempotent, diffable, and re-runnable. Rejected: free-form
    setup conversations (unrepeatable, answers evaporate) and fully-auto
    detection (guesses exactly the things only the human knows — "reduce,
    never invent").
11. **Memory loops are default-on for every project; the global memory is
    two pools** (2026-07-10, user proposal, adopted — supersedes the
    "offer when long-lived" stance inherited from the interactive-era loop
    doc). Every scaffolded project gets the knowledge loop in the kit CORE
    (cost ≈ zero on quiet projects; early lessons are unrecoverable if not
    captured; uniformity is what makes sweeping automatable — the write gate,
    not absence of the loop, is the bloat safeguard). Global memory =
    (a) an **append-only stream** (warehouse): every candidate lesson from
    every sweep, dated, with provenance — read ONLY by a top-level analytical
    agent, NEVER retrieval context for working agents (the 13%-vs-39%
    bloat finding); enables longitudinal analysis (recurrence, demote-recur
    cycles, cross-project failure signatures) that per-sweep convergence
    detection structurally misses; (b) the **distilled pool** (mart): the
    top of the existing audit-loop hierarchy, entered only through its
    promotion gates. Heavy machinery (audit threads, fleets, governor)
    remains earned; the loop itself is not.
12. **Two execution projects opened as ecosystem tracks: `distillery`
    (global memory) and `dispatch` (progress publishing)** (2026-07-10).
    Scaffolded with the Generic Agent Harness, provisional manifests
    (human ratifies at D0/E0 gates), and intake briefs filed here through
    the integrations channel (dispatch-001, distillery-001 — first live use
    of the protocol, incl. the mailbox exception now written into
    INTEGRATIONS §3). Decision-in-principle, gated post-D4/P3: distillery
    becomes the ecosystem's OPERATIONAL lead (the analyst seeds the
    ecosystem curator/governor) while autonomous remains the standards/
    doctrine/kit home — separation of powers between the body that defines
    gates and the entity operating under them. Rejected: autonomous as
    operational lead (conflates standards with operation; its residency is
    meta-level by design).
23. **Model routing is now a DOCTRINE tenet (loaded every session), with an
    explicit Fable-subagent prohibition** (2026-07-13, after a project
    accidentally spawned Fable sub-agents). Root cause: model routing lived
    only here in DECISIONS (16–18), so sessions in other projects never loaded
    it. Fix: added a "Model routing (tiers are human-gated)" tenet to
    doctrine/DOCTRINE.md — which the global CLAUDE.md imports, so it now loads
    everywhere — plus a direct hard-rule line in the global CLAUDE.md itself
    (belt-and-suspenders for a safety rule). Rule: Fable is never used for
    sub-agents or auto-selected for any role unless the human explicitly asks
    in that session; leads→Opus, subagents→Sonnet, scout/verbatim→Haiku;
    tier changes are always the human's deliberate call. Supersedes nothing;
    promotes 16–18 from decisions to loaded doctrine.

28. **Context budget: always-on load slimmed ~40%, with a verify-enforced
    ceiling** (2026-07-16, human-approved after a measured audit: ~5k tokens
    auto-loaded per session, vs the ~100–150-instruction-slot ceiling in
    research/2026-07-10-memory-governance.md). Four changes: (a) INTEGRATIONS
    .md is NO LONGER auto-loaded globally — its doctrine tenet says read it at
    the start of cross-repo work (JIT retrieval per our own research);
    (b) doctrine tenets "survey before scaffold" + "right-size architecture"
    merged into one "Project structuring" tenet (15→14); DOCTRINE.md now has a
    9000-char budget ENFORCED by ./verify — over budget means merge or delete
    a tenet (the landscape audit's DELETIONS section is the pruning organ);
    (c) the charter template's invariant layer no longer restates
    globally-loaded doctrine (reduce-never-invent, visual-first removed;
    doctrine-applies-on-top stated once); (d) manifest rule: NO status prose —
    manifests hold survey answers + territory registry; phase state lives in
    ROADMAP only (observed drift engine: Orrery's 447-char status field
    re-edited in parallel with its ROADMAP). Rejected: leaving growth
    unchecked (addition must be paid for by subtraction, or doctrine becomes
    noise).
55. **Dormancy defers MAINTENANCE, never SECURITY; and declaring it must not
    require a retrofit** (2026-08-17, human ruled monarch dormant, the other
    seven un-retrofit repos to be retrofit). Two refinements the first real
    dormant repo forced. **(a) The line.** A live dormancy declaration now
    also defers `NO-CI`, `KIT-PRE` and `GAPS`, not just `STALE` — adding CI or
    a kit version to finished software nobody develops is a chore nobody will
    do, and an undoable chore on a dashboard is how the dashboard stops being
    read. `LEAK`/`PATH` are computed BEFORE the dormancy branch and are never
    suppressed: a repo nobody develops still leaks in public, and if dormancy
    ever hides exposure it has become a hiding place. Test pins exactly that.
    Expiry restores every deferred chore, louder. **(b) The gap.** Dormancy
    lives in `project.manifest.json`, and monarch had no manifest — so
    "declare this parked" would have cost a full 9-question retrofit for a
    repo whose whole point is that nobody will develop it. Resolved with a
    MINIMAL/DORMANT manifest variant: identity + `dormant` + an explicit note
    that the survey is deliberately unanswered, because answering an
    architecture rung and oracle shape for a finished app would be inventing —
    the exact failure the survey exists to prevent. `/retrofit` runs the real
    survey if it ever wakes. **monarch's `review_by` is 2027-02-17 (6 months),
    defended not defaulted:** it is a delivered training app for one person's
    job at one venue; if the job persists that long it is still in use, and if
    not the repo is archivable — either answer is actionable at that date. The
    human should overrule if that reasoning is wrong, since per antiphon's
    caveat the field is only as good as the honesty of the date.

54. **The session brief is SCOPED to the repo you are in; the scope rule is
    written into the protocol and ships via retrofit** (2026-08-17,
    human-reported). Symptom: agents in several unrelated projects each warned
    the human about ONE uncommitted brief sitting in autonomous's mailbox — a
    repo none of them had standing to touch. Cause was mine: the SessionStart
    hook is installed globally, read the FLEET-WIDE `STATUS.md`, and reported
    its counts into every session regardless of cwd. A requisite-variety
    failure — an attenuator must deliver a signal its recipient can ACT on,
    and fleet state delivered to a leaf project is noise that trains the reader
    to skip the channel. Note this is the OPPOSITE of the failure diagnosed
    one entry earlier: 53 found under-delivery (a ruling that never reached
    its consumer), 54 is over-broadcast. Both are addressing failures, and
    fixing only one would have left the channel useless in the other
    direction.
    **Built:** `kit/hooks/session-brief.py` replaces `fleet-brief.sh` — reports
    only (a) this repo's own overdue/held balls, (b) uncommitted mailbox writes
    HERE, (c) responses to OUR briefs sitting in other repos, and (d) a fleet
    roll-up ONLY when cwd is the standards repo. First run proved it: HYPERSAW
    sees four unread FOUNDATIONS responses and nothing about autonomous, so
    the delivery gap is fleet-wide rather than a distillery quirk.
    `ball_scan.responses_awaiting` is a READ across territories, which rule
    zero permits (it forbids writes); it reports what another repo has already
    said to us.
    **Written down:** INTEGRATIONS §3 gains a "Scope" section with the three
    questions a resident must be able to answer (who owes me / did anyone
    answer me / should I act on X↔Y — the last answered "no"), and kit
    CHANGELOG **2.1.0** makes a `## Mailbox` section in every repo's CLAUDE.md
    a real migration. Deliberately NOT gated by grep: gating prose would
    reward the words over the understanding — the behavioural gate is the
    scoped brief itself. autonomous applied its own 2.1.0 migration and
    declares it.
    **Test-design lesson recorded in passing:** the currency tests hardcoded
    `2.0.0` as the top version and all failed the moment 2.1.0 shipped — the
    test was asserting the kit never moves rather than the property under
    test. They now read the live `kit/VERSION`.

53. **`absorbs` ruled into library-entry.3 (not v4); and a RESPONSE-DELIVERY
    gap found in the INTEGRATIONS protocol** (2026-08-17, distillery-004).
    Ruling: distillery's option (b), a distinct `absorbs: L0011, L0021,
    L0034` reference list, semantically *folded in, not invalidated* —
    because the distinction is load-bearing downstream. `supersedes` means
    the target was WRONG (do not promote); `absorbs` means the target is now
    a SPECIAL CASE whose evidence contributes to the survivor's weight.
    Option (a) (multi-valued supersedes) would make a consolidation
    indistinguishable from a multi-way invalidation to an analyst walking the
    chains; option (c) pushes a real graph edge into prose, the loss v2
    already rejected for annotated placeholders. One bad element quarantines
    the entry — a half-parsed consolidation is a lie about the graph.
    **Landed as an AMENDMENT to v3, not a v4**, and the licence is narrow and
    stated in the contract: no consumer had implemented v3 yet (distillery's
    parser still declares `library-entry.2`), so amending cost zero
    migrations where a v4 would have cost two. Amending a contract a consumer
    HAS implemented is a different act and is not licensed by this.
    **The larger finding:** brief-004 (filed 2026-08-12) listed
    distillery-003 and report-002 §3 as "still open" — both were ruled
    2026-08-10 in `response-003.md`. Verified: the response is committed and
    pushed here; their parser has no v3 reference. **A response lands in the
    PROVIDER's repo and nothing signals the consumer it arrived.** `ball_scan`
    reads a repo's own mailbox, so from the consumer's side an answered
    thread and an ignored one are identical until someone pulls and reads.
    Third instance of this shape in two weeks (Life-OS could not locate a
    brief filed into its own tree; two mailbox writes sat untracked twelve
    days). The `ball:` field assigns responsibility; the protocol has no
    DELIVERY signal. Fix is autonomous's to design — candidate: ball_scan
    reads the mailboxes addressed TO a repo in other roster repos, not only
    its own, which is a read across territories and therefore needs a
    doctrine ruling rather than just code. Queued, not built.

52. **K1 built — `/retrofit` is a CHANGELOG-driven migration; the standards
    repo failed its own first check** (2026-08-17). `kit/currency.py` is the
    deterministic half: reads the declared `kit_version`, diffs against
    CHANGELOG, emits the ordered delta with a presence check per requirement.
    `REQUIREMENTS` in that file is the GATE per version and the CHANGELOG
    prose is the explanation; a test pins that every CHANGELOG version has a
    row, so a migration cannot be silently skipped. `/retrofit` opens by
    running it, works the delta, and closes by running it again requiring
    `nothing to do` — the K1 gate ("re-running is a no-op") is CHECKED, not
    hoped. Its five behaviours are unchanged; only the target changed.
    **First real run found autonomous itself in drift:** declared 2.0.0 one
    hour earlier (Decision 51) with no root CLAUDE.md. The `declared_but_
    missing` check exists for exactly this and fired on its first subject.
    Fixed by writing the CLAUDE.md the check demanded (lean root: pointers +
    six gotchas each of which cost an incident), NOT by loosening the check;
    `./verify fast` now runs autonomous's own currency and goes red on
    drift, proven by hiding CLAUDE.md and watching it fire. Also: `./verify`
    checks EXECUTABILITY of verify, not existence — the Write tool does not
    set the exec bit (retrofit gotcha 2026-07-12), and a verify that exists
    but cannot run is not a verify. **TOOL_ONLY versions:** 2.0.1 changes the
    retrofit tool and asks nothing of repos; a repo at 2.0.0 reads CURRENT
    against it, or the checker manufactures 46 rows of behind-by-nothing —
    noise that gets a tool ignored (L0002's cousin).

51. **Phase K opened — kit currency toward one structure at every level;
    K0 (kit version) built** (2026-08-17, human-directed; session model
    Fable, explicitly selected). Five directives arrived at once — uniform
    external-ingest structure, rebuild `/retrofit`, a catch-up command +
    audit, daily/weekly routines, and the recursive-VSM frame as its own
    phase — plus a re-opened file restructure. Sequenced by dependency, and
    one fact reshaped the order: **the kit had no version number.** "Catch
    this repo up" is unanswerable without a version to catch up TO; without
    one, currency is re-derived every run and drift is invisible until
    collision — the wrapper-registry failure again. So K0 first:
    `kit/VERSION` (2.0.0 baseline), `kit/CHANGELOG.md` where every entry
    names its retrofit action, `kit_version` read by sweep and reported by
    monitor as `KIT-PRE` at INFO (46/47 repos are pre-2.0.0 today; a WARN on
    all of them buries real WARNs). Absence is read as `pre-2.0.0`, NEVER as
    current — a declaration that defaults to "fine" is no declaration.
    autonomous gained its own manifest and declares 2.0.0: the standards
    repo cannot be the one repo with no standing against its own kit.
    Then K1 `/retrofit` rebuilt as a CHANGELOG-driven MIGRATION (its five
    behaviours kept verbatim — they are right; what it lacked was a target),
    K2 `intake/` with per-drop `PROVENANCE.md` (the provenance tenet applied
    inbound: an undated unattributed spec is indistinguishable from an
    injected one; HYPERSAW already does this ad hoc), K3 the session-boundary
    commands (brief ratified in chat), K4 the currency audit + reviewed-batch
    catch-up (never a swarm — no oracle, no swarm), K5 routines as CADENCE
    over pieces that already exist. Restructure sequenced AFTER K4 so the
    audit is not run against paths that then move. **Phase R (recursive-VSM
    frame) is deliberately LAST and its own phase**, prior-art bookend first:
    K0–K5 are the empirical material the frame is written FROM; a frame
    written before the mechanisms exist is a frame about nothing. Rejected:
    building `/retrofit` first (no version to migrate toward) and the frame
    first (inventing).

50. **New-project sweep clean; the human-TODO surface is on the roadmap as a
    lens, not a tracker** (2026-08-15, human-directed). Sweep: 12 repos
    created since the session opened (root-commit date — the first heuristic,
    `git log --reverse --max-count=1`, returned the NEWEST commit and put
    autonomous's birthday at 2026-08-15; corrected to `rev-list
    --max-parents=0` before trusting a single row). All 12 carry the full
    harness; 10/12 have CI (the two without are the two with no remote —
    showcase, resume-workshop — a Windows-clone concern already on record).
    Four were not in the execution-project registry and now are: plainsynth
    (FOUNDATIONS' validation canary), spectral-morph, mind-lathe (private;
    carries Life-OS's hidden-hub-path constraint, and its vite.config names
    the prefix — harmless while private, a finding on flip), juce-rag (the
    high-risk MCP shape, first in the L0003 sweep line).
    **Human TODO.** The human wants one list of everything waiting on them.
    Measured: 8 manifests PROVISIONAL awaiting ratification and NOTHING
    surfaces them; 1 open PR; 4 pushes held; 2 uncommitted mailbox writes.
    The signals exist across six mechanisms; what is missing is one
    collector that re-reads them through "does this need a human?" Queued as
    T0–T3 in ROADMAP: T0 deterministic collector in the governor with a gate
    that NO agent-actionable item may appear (an agent chore on the human's
    list trains the human to skip the list); T1 a `todo.1` contract so
    dispatch RENDERS it in the digest rather than re-collecting (blocked on
    the status.1 producer gap, Decision 45 — otherwise it is the second
    contract with zero producers); T2 a ratified declaration form so
    residents can raise a human-gated item; T3 done = the sweep observing
    the item gone, never a checkbox. Non-goals stated: no AI in the
    collector, no nagging beyond the session brief + algedonic channel, no
    separate tracker — the files are the tracker, this is a lens.

49. **autonomous gets its own LIBRARY.md/INDEX.md — the standards repo had
    nowhere to file a lesson** (2026-08-14). Surfaced when the Life-OS
    resident closed autonomous-lifeos-001 with a lesson explicitly offered
    "for your LIBRARY" and this repo — author of the LIBRARY contract, ruler
    of three versions of it — had no LIBRARY at all, five weeks in. First
    piece of the self-retrofit gap (3/8 harness coverage) closed. Four entries
    seeded, every one evidence-backed from this session: cloud-image sshd
    drop-in precedence (Life-OS's finding: `sed` on the main file is silently
    overridden by cloud-init's `50-*.conf`; write `00-*.conf` and assert with
    `sshd -T`); `git grep -E` has no `\s`/`\d`/`\b` and a never-fired gate is
    not a gate (three instances in five weeks); MCP SDK 2.0 moved
    `mcp.server.fastmcp` with the try-2.x-fall-back-1.x migration proven both
    ways; consumer-authored contract tests catch the dialect the provider does
    not write. **Validated against distillery's real v3 parser rather than by
    eye** — which immediately quarantined L0001 for `origin: life-os-app#L?`,
    a back-link to an entry that does not exist yet. The contract was right
    and the entry was wrong: recorded as a leaf, to be promoted when
    life-os-app files its own copy. The parser is the oracle for its own
    contract; the ruler does not get to eyeball it. autonomous-lifeos-001
    CLOSED by the resident: box verified hardened (one real finding fixed
    live and durably), mcp migrated not pinned, CI pin dropped by them.

48. **VSM amendments A–D built** (2026-08-14, human ratified all four in one
    word; each was designed as a separate gate and the human collapsed them —
    recorded as one entry so the collapse is visible). **A** — `s4_scan.py`:
    S4-STALE (research artifact age), S4-UNMERGED (a `landscape-audit/*`
    branch on the remote with no merged PR — reads the REMOTE, not local refs),
    OPEN-PR (any open PR here is an obligation on the human nothing else
    surfaces); network failure yields S4-UNKNOWN, never quiet. Fired on its
    first run against exactly the state under dispute at the time: PR #2 open,
    branch stranded. Session brief now names S4 findings, not counts. **B** —
    "Outside & then" section in STATUS.md above the exchanges. **C** —
    environment-watch remit in the audit prompt (protocol cadence, platform
    shifts, provider policy, CI economics: four collisions, now watched).
    **D** — `algedonic.py` + weekly GitHub Actions cron, DETERMINISTIC (no
    model in the signal path — a pain signal that depends on judgement can be
    talked out of firing or fire on a hallucination), scope stated as
    GitHub-visible only. Notification is the failed run itself: no webhook, no
    third-party notifier, nothing extra to fail silently; a broken check exits
    1 and is ALSO red. **First live run: 5 pain signals** — the known
    Audiology leak, a previously UNKNOWN 35-line public leak in `life-os-app`
    including a Windows path with a second username (the Windows pattern from
    Decision 34 paying for itself; the local sweep never scanned it because of
    the wrapper bug), and red default-branch CI on quantum-morph, edgewise,
    catena. Empty repos excluded after two reported as "unknown" — noise
    dressed as uncertainty is how a pain channel gets muted.
    **Also recorded:** the human said "Merged" of PR #2 and GitHub said OPEN
    (`mergedAt: null`, verified after fetch + wait). Treated as unmerged. That
    is transducer distortion, Beer's exact term, and it is why the pr-status
    hook and s4_scan read the remote and never the human's recollection.

47. **Beer's Viable System Model adopted as the governor's vocabulary;
    machinery queued, not built** (2026-08-14, human-directed after reading
    Beer; session model Fable, explicitly human-selected). The framework
    converged on VSM empirically — the July–August incident record is a list
    of failures Beer named fifty years ago: transducer distortion (the early
    "merged"), audit captured by self-report (the wrapper registry), missing
    algedonics (the 19-day public leak), channel ambiguity (day-resolution
    ball dates), a dead regulator indistinguishable from a healthy fleet (the
    monitor crash). Adopting the vocabulary is adopting compression: one
    sentence to a fresh-context agent instead of one incident per lesson.
    Mapping: S1=repos/territories (recursion real at fleet→repo), S2=
    INTEGRATIONS+contracts (strongest), S3=human+ordering constraints
    (correctly human-carried at this scale), S3*=monitor/leak_scan/ball_scan
    ("derived, never declared" IS the audit-channel principle), S4=landscape
    audit (thinnest), S5=doctrine-import+ratification gates (Decision 12
    already guards Beer's S5-into-S3 collapse). Pathology verdict: guilty on
    missing S4 and missing algedonics only — and S4 was demonstrated LIVE
    during the analysis: the 2026-08 audit ran on schedule, opened PR #2 on
    2026-08-10, and sat unsurfaced four days because nothing transduces an
    open PR into the human's attention. POSIWID and requisite-variety adopted
    as standing tests (every mechanism is an attenuator or amplifier for the
    human channel; its noise floor is its capacity). Amendments A–D queued in
    ROADMAP as SEPARATE ratifications — vocabulary now, machinery each on its
    own gate. Rejected: a doctrine tenet (budget 8729/9000; DESIGN §4 + the
    research note suffice) and the classic VSM misuse of building five boxes
    as staff functions ahead of need — the controller half stays deferred
    until a fleet exists, which Beer would endorse: metasystem grows with S1
    variety. Full mapping incl. recorded strain points:
    research/2026-08-14-viable-system-model-mapping.md.

46. **`library-entry.3`: block form admitted on read; distillery's three
    corpus-forced rules adopted; a response letter is never normative**
    (2026-08-10, ruling report-002 §3 + distillery-003). Three adoptions cost
    consumers nothing — structural terminators, the span-open condition, and
    repeated-label continuation-join were already live in distillery, invented
    because implementing v2 against the real corpus required them. Leaving them
    consumer-side is how a contract and its only implementation drift apart
    while both look healthy. The span-open residual risk is recorded, not
    hidden; the structural fix (`[[Lxxxx]]` for cross-refs) is named as the
    destination but NOT ruled, because the corpus is mixed and mandating it
    today strands existing prose.
    **distillery-003 — block form.** ~20 entries across 8+ projects were
    invisible under v1 AND v2, a larger silent loss than v2's ruling recovered.
    It is not one heading form but THREE serializations (bracketed id, bare
    id + em-dash, bare id with the title on the next line) with fields as
    `**label:**`, `- **label:**`, or `| label:`. The check that decided it: do
    they carry the REQUIRED fields, or is this a format that cannot express one?
    Verified against all four projects — every one carries lesson, evidence and
    falsifier. Had they not, the answer would have been migration, because a
    format that cannot express a required field is not a format variant.
    Admitted on READ; line form stays canonical on WRITE. Rejected migration:
    it needs 8 independent residents under writes-stay-home, with every entry
    invisible until the last one acts. The exhaustive still-quarantines list is
    UNCHANGED v2→v3 and the contract now says so — v3 admits new delimiters and
    one new layout, no new absence.
    **Correction on the record:** the distillery-002 response letter said bare
    tier matches "by enum, not by position"; the contract said segment-1 AND
    enum-match. distillery implemented the contract and flagged the discrepancy.
    The letter was wrong — enum-match-anywhere lets a bare enum word in prose
    overwrite `tier`, silent corruption rather than a parse failure. General
    rule now stated in the contract: **the contract file is normative; a
    response letter never is.**

45. **`status.1` contract tests landed in CI; the contract has zero producers**
    (2026-08-09, closing dispatch-001's owed item, 16 days past respond-by).
    dispatch's three fixtures landed verbatim with a stdlib validator
    (`kit/gates/status_validate.py`) wired into `./verify fast`. Two design
    calls. (a) **Returns a list of findings, not a bool** — their third fixture
    pins error GRANULARITY (four *named* findings), which is a materially
    stronger contract than "must be rejected": it catches a validator that
    rejects the right document for the wrong reason, which passes a pass/fail
    test while being useless to a consumer repairing its own output.
    (b) **Targeted validator, not a JSON Schema engine, zero dependencies** —
    this CI installs nothing, so a `jsonschema` dep would be red-for-unrelated-
    reasons or skipped, and a skipped check is the blind-gate trap
    (REPO-HYGIENE). `kit/contracts/status.md` stays normative.
    **The finding the filing surfaced:** swept all 62 repos — NONE emit
    `STATUS.json`, including autonomous, which authored the contract. The writer
    "ships with kit v2 core" and kit v2 is not open, so `status.1` has been
    frozen a month with a schema, an example, one consumer built against it and
    **no producer anywhere**. A contract validated only from the consumer side is
    untested in the direction that matters: nobody has tried to EMIT one and
    discovered the schema asks for something a real project cannot cheaply
    produce. Writer deliberately NOT built here — it is kit-v2 scope and
    building ahead of the kit is how a "temporary" second implementation becomes
    permanent — but the gap is now on the record rather than implicit in a
    degrade-visibly clause that has only ever run in the degraded direction.

44. **Registry paths are case-checked; `path_case_mismatch` reported, never
    auto-corrected** (2026-08-09, from FOUNDATIONS' foundations-001 four-state
    note). They flagged `Morphos`/`morphos` and warned a cross-platform roster
    sweep will hit it, failing in the worst way — a false alarm on the first
    run, when the reader is deciding whether to trust the tool. We had it live:
    `registry.json` carried `~/Documents/tonality-Live` against `Tonality-Live`
    on disk. macOS is case-INSENSITIVE but case-PRESERVING so it resolved
    silently; Linux CI would not, and a second machine is being set up this
    week. Entry corrected; `sweep.derive_status` now reports the disk spelling
    with a test. REPORTED, not auto-corrected — which spelling is canonical is
    the human's call, same stance as `nested_repos`. Chose reporting over
    FOUNDATIONS' `(st_dev, st_ino)` identity comparison deliberately: identity
    RESOLVES the mismatch invisibly, right for a sweep that must not cry wolf,
    but here it is a portability bug worth fixing rather than tolerating. Their
    roster must survive a rename; ours must survive a clone.

43. **`contract_gate` landed as kit-core; second consumer established
    empirically, not by argument** (2026-08-09, foundations-001 proposal).
    FOUNDATIONS offered the enforcement half of Decision 39 — does the file the
    manifest names as the contract declare a version — deliberately narrow: no
    semver ordering, no bump-detection, no prose reading, because Decision 39's
    second half (*was the freeze respected?*) is a human ruling and stays one.
    Landed at `kit/gates/contract_gate.py`. Their two-consumer caveat was
    honest but their proposed answer ("the second consumer is the doctrine
    itself") is self-ratifying — a rule wanting its own enforcement is not
    independent evidence. The real second consumer is empirical: **Orrery, the
    composite worked reference, declares no `contract-version:`**, while its own
    manifest says Lathe pins a version and files briefs for deltas — a live
    pinning relationship against a contract with nothing to pin. FOUNDATIONS
    explicitly refused to check Orrery ("it is not my tree, and if it does not,
    that is a finding for its residents rather than a stick to hand you"), which
    was the correct call; checking it is autonomous's scope. Four negative tests
    re-implemented rather than cited — a gate landed on someone else's word is a
    gate nobody has run — plus one added: prose mentioning `contract-version:`
    mid-line must FAIL, pinning the anchor a future "simplification" would drop.
    Kit changes reach existing repos only on retrofit, so nothing breaks today;
    the Orrery finding is filed separately.

42. **Overdue-`ball:` detection, and why the sweep runs from a session hook
    rather than a scheduler** (2026-08-09). The INTEGRATIONS `ball:` field
    assigns responsibility and nothing escalated it: three exchanges surfaced
    in one week only because the human mentioned them (distillery-002, 13 days
    past respond-by with named content blocked; two mailbox writes untracked
    ~12 days each). `governor/ball_scan.py` now sweeps every repo's mailbox.
    Four modelling rules, each forced by a false positive on the FIRST real
    run — the module is only useful if it is read, so every one of these is
    really a defence against noise: (a) the unit is the exchange **id**, not
    the file — an opening `brief.md` keeps `ball: provider` forever and the
    answer lands in a sibling, so per-file evaluation reports every answered
    thread as permanently overdue; (b) **closure is monotonic** and beats
    date-ordering — antiphon-001 read as 12d overdue while CLOSED because its
    ratification carried the same date as the response it closed; (c) overdue
    is computed **only when the ball is ours** — a respond-by binds the holder,
    so once we answer it is satisfied, not breached; (d) only files that ASSERT
    a ball may determine who holds it — FOUNDATIONS' `ball: none` informational
    note, filed 34 seconds after a real proposal, masked a live ask. Reported
    in its OWN STATUS section, never folded into the ~56-WARN pile, since an
    obligation buried there is findable only by someone already looking.
    **Scheduling: rejected launchd/cron after trying it.** macOS TCC protects
    `~/Documents` and a LaunchAgent does not inherit Full Disk Access, so the
    job returned "Operation not permitted" (exit 512) while STATUS.md kept the
    mtime of a manual run — installed-looking, fresh-looking, doing nothing.
    Granting FDA to a bare interpreter is a worse trade. Instead: a synchronous
    SessionStart hook reads the cache (instant) and an `async` one refreshes it
    (~4s, off the critical path), so the sweep runs with the file access a
    session already has and needs no scheduler. Freshness gap is one session
    and the brief prints the cache age, so staleness is visible rather than
    assumed — the failure that killed the monitor silently for days.

41. **Correspondent-roster sweep: promote signal MET by convergent independent
    derivation; kit-v2 candidate, build deferred** (2026-08-09, foundations-001
    §4). FOUNDATIONS offered a four-state correspondent registry + drift sweep
    as a report, not a request, correctly noting the two-consumer rule left it
    at one consumer. The second consumer is THIS repo, unknown to them: on
    2026-07-27 `registry.json` was found pointing at wrapper directories, and
    five repos — including PUBLIC `audiology`, carrying a machine-identity leak
    for 19 days — were invisible to leak_scan/monitor/clone-roster while the
    roster reported their names as present. Both fixes converged on the same
    shape AND the same deliberate restraint: detect drift, report loudly,
    **never mutate the roster** ("discovering a repo is not registering it" /
    "surfaced, never auto-adopted"). Convergent design under independent
    derivation is the strongest signal the two-consumer rule can produce, and
    neither party could see it alone — which is itself an argument for filing
    resolved-locally findings upstream. Generalization frozen: a hand-maintained
    roster of relationships drifts from reality silently; the countermeasure is
    a deterministic declared-vs-observed sweep that blocks only on
    project-controlled state and cannot mutate the roster. NOT built today —
    kit v2 is not open, and a half-generalized version is worse than two working
    specific ones. FOUNDATIONS' `deferred-with-revisit-trigger` state is the
    piece autonomous lacks: without it the same finding re-surfaces every sweep
    and trains the reader to skip it.

40. **Prior-art bookend inverts for design-first projects, on the record**
    (2026-08-09, foundations-001 §3, ACCEPTED). Decision 30 put Phase 0
    prior-art before the design is committed; a project arriving with a human's
    founding document cannot run that order. Ruling: run it as an AMENDMENT
    PASS against the committed design, inversion recorded in DECISIONS, plus one
    acceptance criterion that is the load-bearing part — **contradictions become
    DECISIONS proposals, never absorbed or discarded**. Without that criterion a
    late pass is *performed rather than used*, and the failure is invisible
    because both produce the same artifact. Rejected: dropping the phase
    (loses it) and silently reordering (loses the record that it was inverted).
    Evidence the form bites, verified rather than accepted: FOUNDATIONS' F1
    produced 8 proposals against an already-committed constitution.

39. **A composite contract file may be a versioned WRAPPER over a normative
    source** (2026-08-09, foundations-001 §2, ACCEPTED). ONBOARDING composite
    move 1 implied the contract document must contain the seam's prose;
    FOUNDATIONS' seam was already §2/§4/§5 of a human-written constitution, so
    following it literally meant duplicating canonical content — a bug under
    README §8, and two copies of a contract drift until no consumer can say
    which text it pinned. Ruling: the invariant is that **exactly one file owns
    the version and the freeze state**, not that it holds the prose; a
    normative-source table satisfies move 1. Move 1 conflated "one place to pin"
    with "one place the text lives" because Orrery — the only worked reference —
    had a contract written AS the contract, so nothing forced the distinction. A
    single worked example is a weak generalization. FOUNDATIONS' offered
    `contract-version:` freeze check accepted as a kit-core gate candidate:
    prose is the reminder, the gate is the enforcement.

38. **FOUNDATIONS registered in the ecosystem tracks; execution projects are no
    longer assumed to be leaves** (2026-08-09, brief foundations-001).
    Registered per the HYPERSAW/ANTIPHON shape. `registry.json` needed no edit —
    verified rather than accepted, the `synthetic-worlds` group rule already
    resolves it with a full harness. But the Execution-project registry's own
    preamble describes its entries as leaves that "feed back only through their
    group scope's knowledge-loop harvest," and FOUNDATIONS is upstream of eight
    registered consumers: its F2 gates HYPERSAW's extraction and a
    contract-version event is an eight-way fan-out. Registering it under a
    description false about it would have been the drift this protocol exists to
    prevent, so a fifth cross-track ordering constraint was added — the first in
    that list originating in an execution project rather than Track A. The leaf
    assumption still holds for every other entry; it needed naming, not silent
    amendment.

37. **`library-entry.2`: the parser loses nothing, the promotion gate judges**
    (2026-07-31, ruling distillery-002 — 13 days past respond-by). Five open
    questions, one principle. A `|`-delimited format that forbids `|` in prose
    is not strict, it is broken (CSV without quoting): HYPERSAW L0016
    quarantined because its lesson contains `|x[n]-x[n-1]|`, absolute-value
    notation in a DSP lesson, and L0016 is domain-general promotion-grade
    content. Rulings: (1) entry boundary is the `[Lxxxx]` marker not the
    newline — fixes morphos/edgewise/wont's 7 wrapped entries with zero
    resident work and needs no continuation character; (2) unlabeled segments
    continue the open field — rejected escaping, which requires every author to
    remember and fails silently when they don't; (3) both tier forms accepted,
    but the bare form is recognized by ENUM MATCH not position, else a title
    containing `|` silently corrupts `tier` (worse than quarantining);
    (4) annotated placeholders → field absent + annotation preserved as
    `<field>_note`, rejecting distillery's option (b) because those annotations
    are real graph edges ("generalises [[L0014]]") and dropping them deletes
    the relational knowledge the warehouse exists to hold; (5) unknown labels →
    `extra{}`, neither quarantining a good entry nor dropping data.
    **Explicitly NOT a weakened gate**: everything newly accepted is a
    formatting variation carrying identical information; everything still
    rejected is missing information, and the contract now lists the four
    quarantining cases exhaustively so forgiveness cannot creep. Falsifier and
    evidence requirements untouched.

36. **Dormancy is a machine-readable, EXPIRING manifest field** (2026-07-28,
    responding to brief `antiphon-001`). ANTIPHON asked to be listed in
    ROADMAP's execution-project registry as deliberately dormant, so a green
    oracle with no commits would not read as abandoned. Granted — but the
    listing alone does not solve the stated problem: `governor/monitor.py` does
    not read ROADMAP.md, so prose is legible to humans and invisible to the
    governor. ANTIPHON trips `STALE` on 2026-08-12 regardless. So dormancy is
    now `project.manifest.json` → `dormant {since, reason, review_by}`, honored
    by monitor. **`review_by` is required**: a permanent flag is how abandoned
    repos hide, so a live declaration suppresses STALE at INFO, an expired one
    raises DORMANT-EXPIRED at WARN *and* restores STALE, and one missing
    `review_by` is ignored entirely — the incomplete form fails toward noise,
    never toward silence. Defers the activity signal only; LEAK/UNGATED/NO-CI
    still fire, because a dormant repo can still be insecure. The brief itself
    proposed this as the better answer; it was right.

35. **monitor gets per-repo fault isolation after one manifest killed it**
    (2026-07-28). `manifest_status_prose` assumed `status` was a string;
    `juce-rag` ships a structured `{"ratified":…, "note":…}` — arguably the
    better shape — and the TypeError took down the entire fleet dashboard. A
    crashed monitor reports nothing, which is indistinguishable from a healthy
    fleet: the precise silent failure the tool exists to catch. Two fixes, and
    the second matters more: (a) flatten dict/list statuses and scan the strings
    inside, so structure cannot smuggle prose past the check either; (b) wrap
    each repo's checks so an unexpected shape yields a HIGH `MONITOR-ERROR` row
    for that repo instead of killing the run. One repo's schema choice must
    never be able to blind the whole sweep. Found only because a brief required
    running monitor — it had been silently dead.

34. **Cross-platform portability made a gate, not a habit** (2026-07-23,
    prompted by the human cloning the roster onto a Windows machine). Three
    silent-failure vectors closed before the clone rather than after:
    (a) **the leak gates were POSIX-only** — `/(Users|home)/<name>/` cannot
    match `C:\Users\<name>\`, so identity committed FROM Windows would have
    passed every gate. Both detectors (bash `leak_gate`, `leak_scan.py`) now
    carry the drive-letter form, with `\\+` so the escaped variant that lands
    in JSON matches too; `USERNAME` added alongside `USER` for the username
    check. (b) **CRLF** — Git for Windows' `core.autocrlf=true` default
    rewrites checkouts, so identical content has different bytes and every
    byte-comparison gate (`content_hash`, hash ledgers, goldens) fails for a
    reason unrelated to the change; a CRLF shebang also kills `./verify` with
    a bare "command not found". Fixed by a committed `.gitattributes`
    (`* text=auto eol=lf`), which beats a global git setting because it
    travels with the repo. (c) **INSTALL-GLOBAL was macOS-only** — new §6
    covers shell (Git Bash, not PowerShell), `python3` availability, clone
    layout for the `~` import, and the Mac-only AU/`auval` exclusion.
    Verified by running the new pattern against known-bad input in raw,
    escaped, and drive-letter forms BEFORE trusting it (the `\s` lesson);
    the test also caught the gate flagging its own explanatory comment, fixed
    by rewriting the comment rather than allowlisting the gate file —
    allowlisting `verify` would blind the gate to real leaks in it.
    Not yet done: `.gitattributes` exists only here; the fleet-wide rollout
    rides the mass-retrofit, and the 22 non-cloneable dirs (3 git-no-remote,
    19 not git) will simply be absent on the Windows machine.
33. **REPO-HYGIENE.md adopted as the canonical security-sweep spec**
    (2026-07-20, human "adopt repo-hygiene"). Moved root → `governor/`; folded
    in the review corrections: (a) secrets scans FAIL-CLOSED on a missing tool,
    never skip (the blind-gate trap that bit us twice); (b) tiered — the
    deps-free `leak_gate` is the Layer-0 CI core, gitleaks/rg live in the
    pre-commit hook + pre-publication audit, not the CI-blocking gate; (c)
    reconciled with the shipped code (leak_gate/leak_scan/monitor/allowlist are
    now its implementation, not a divergent parallel). New content: the
    binary-file gap — `git grep -I` skips binaries, so `.pyc`/EXIF/notebook
    leaks pass every text gate (the tracked-`.pyc` incident, Decision 32's
    cleanup); defense is gitignore/strip, not scan. Doctrine tenet + governor
    README point at it. Allowlisted at the new path so it doesn't trip its own
    gate. Rejected: adopting the doc as-written (its `command -v gitleaks ||
    skip` was fail-open — the exact failure the review caught).

32. **Governor built as the watchdog-MONITOR first; controller deferred**
    (2026-07-20, human "do it"). `governor/monitor.py`: a deterministic
    (no-model) fleet-health sweep — per-repo leaks, un-gated verify, no-CI,
    stale README, manifest status-prose (Dec 28), harness gaps → STATUS
    dashboard. Earned NOW (this session kept hitting these by hand); the
    HALT-sentinel/conductor/coherence-critic stay deferred (no running organ
    fleet to govern — building the control room for an idle factory is the
    speculative escalation the doctrine forbids). First real run caught a
    LEAK regression: Tonality's paths, fixed at commit ca47050, were
    REINTRODUCED by later CLAUDE.md regeneration and went uncaught because
    Tonality is UN-GATED — validating both the monitor and "un-gated repos are
    where leaks recur." Fixed a consistency bug: `leak_scan.py` had drifted
    from the `./verify` leak_gate (missing the `%`/`@` placeholder filters +
    the .leakcheck-allow honoring) → the monitor false-flagged repos the gate
    passed; re-synced, with a comment that the two detectors must stay
    consistent. STATUS.md gitignored (it names private repos — committing it
    to public autonomous would be the cross-repo leak the monitor hunts).

31. **CI-minutes budget: economical triggers, cancel superseded, heavy builds
    stay local** (2026-07-20, after the human hit the free-tier private-repo
    Actions limit). Only PRIVATE repos spend minutes (2000/mo free; public
    unlimited); the drain is private + heavy (JUCE/C++/`auval` — macOS runners
    at ~10× Linux). Kit CI template now defaults: triggers = PRs + push-to-main
    only (feature-branch feedback still via the PR), `concurrency` cancels
    superseded runs, `paths-ignore` skips docs-only, and `verify full` (auval/
    codesign) stays out of CI (local/human). Contrast Decision 26 (get CI
    running everywhere) — this is HOW, economically. Rejected: on-every-push
    everywhere (what exhausted the quota) and moving heavy repos public just
    for free minutes (visibility is an IP decision, not a CI one — VISIBILITY.md).
    Retrofit propagates the economical template; existing repos' agents adopt it.

30. **ROADMAP carries Prior-Art bookend phases (agent swarm)** (2026-07-18,
    user). Every scaffolded ROADMAP includes an EARLY "Phase 0 — Prior-art
    landscape" (fan-out research before the design is committed: existing
    solutions, papers, patents, competing products, failure modes → reflected
    in design + DECISIONS) and a LATE "pre-ship Prior-art & IP re-scan"
    (re-run before public release; patent/IP landscape for anything
    commercializable, per the disclosure-timing asymmetry in VISIBILITY.md).
    Findings live in `docs/prior-art.md`, dated + cited. In the ROADMAP
    skeleton (kit/scaffold-agentic-harness.prompt.md). Rationale: the swarm
    reaches adjacent domains a single searcher misses (basin-escape, per the
    methodology research); early prevents reinventing/landmines, late catches
    drift + protects IP before the irreversible act of disclosure. Kit-level,
    not a doctrine tenet (budget; it's a ROADMAP-artifact rule).

29. **Foreign-scaffold override clause: standard mechanisms, project
    substance** (2026-07-16, user). Chat-exported kits (a Claude session
    exporting a starter scaffold) conflict with the spinup/retrofit protocol.
    Reconciliation rule, now in ONBOARDING + /retrofit: for any function the
    ecosystem kit provides, the kit's mechanism REPLACES the exported one
    (two half-compatible mechanisms = drift by construction); the exported
    kit's project-specific substance is MIGRATED into standard slots
    (§Domain, ROADMAP, DECISIONS, LIBRARY seeds, bespoke checks → verify
    targets) BEFORE anything is deleted; unmappable content is surfaced to
    the human, never silently discarded. Map first, replace second, delete
    only what has been mapped. Rejected: letting exported conventions stand
    alongside kit conventions (dual mechanisms) and wholesale replacement
    (destroys idiosyncratic project value — often the bespoke checks).

27. **Privacy is enforced by a gate, not a sweep** (2026-07-13). `leak_gate` is
    now kit-core: a self-contained bash function in every project's `./verify`
    (so it blocks the Stop hook AND CI from one artifact — a repo must be
    verifiable without autonomous cloned, hence the deliberate copy rather than
    a shared import). Doctrine tenet added: "Never commit machine identity."
    `governor/leak_scan.py` demoted to fleet *backstop* (un-gated repos +
    cross-repo private-name exposure, which a per-repo gate structurally cannot
    see). Rationale: a monthly sweep leaves a leak live for up to 30 days; a
    commit-time gate makes it zero. History remediation: see
    governor/HISTORY-REMEDIATION.md — verdict is "don't, except dispatch (whose
    bad blobs are unpushed, so rewriting is free)"; a rewrite cannot un-expose
    what is already public, so it buys little at real cost.
    **Self-audit (uncomfortable, recorded):** autonomous itself is 3/8 on the
    harness it defines — missing CLAUDE.md, manifest, knowledge loop, traces,
    hooks — violating its own Decision 11. Retrofitting the standards repo is
    now a tracked task; the session's real lessons (exec-bit, bare-except
    swallowing an import error, `\s` dead in POSIX ERE) currently have no
    durable in-repo home, which is exactly what a LIBRARY is for.

26. **CI is a kit-core property: GitHub Actions runs `./verify fast` on every
    push/PR** (2026-07-13, user goal "every project runs CI"). Not new checks —
    the cloud runs the project's one oracle, mirroring the local Stop-hook gate.
    Reference workflow added to autonomous (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`);
    template at `kit/templates/ci.github.yml` ships via `/spinup`, retrofits
    via `/retrofit`. Nuances recorded: needs a remote; `verify full` runs in CI
    only where the runner supports it (audio-plugin auval/codesign is macOS-only
    + human-run → CI `fast` only); private repos draw Actions-minutes quota.
    Rollout respects writes-stay-home: each repo's residents add their own
    workflow (autonomous done as reference; others via their agents or explicit
    human authorization). This is also the required-checks foundation the P2
    merge queue assumes.

25. **Model-routing rule generalized: pin explicitly + cap at Opus**
    (2026-07-13, human — "better than 'never Fable'"). Supersedes the
    Fable-specific framing of #23. Two rules attacking the actual failure mode
    (silent inheritance): (1) every agent's model is PINNED at spawn, never
    inherited from the session/parent default; (2) never exceed the latest
    Opus — the Claude 5 flagship family (Fable) or any future above-Opus tier
    is used only on explicit human request. Durable (a ceiling, not a name
    that goes stale) and root-cause (the accident was an inherited tier, not a
    named one). In DOCTRINE.md "Model routing (pin explicitly; cap at Opus)".

24. **Correction to #23: the Fable rule lives ONLY in DOCTRINE.md, not
    duplicated in the global CLAUDE.md** (2026-07-13). #23 also added a direct
    hard-rule line to the global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` — that violated
    INSTALL-GLOBAL.md's "never edit doctrine in the global file; redundant
    copies drift" split rule, AND it does not propagate (global files are
    machine-local, never synced). Removed it. The DOCTRINE.md tenet + the
    `@import` every machine's global file already carries is the single source
    and the propagation mechanism: a machine gets the rule by `git pull` on
    autonomous — nothing to hand-edit per machine. The "belt-and-suspenders"
    instinct was wrong here: if the import fails, ALL doctrine fails visibly,
    so one duplicated rule buys nothing.

22. **Licensing: public showcases get PolyForm NC; private commercial
    candidates stay unlicensed until productization** (2026-07-13, human).
    Tonality + Audiology carry PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0 (grant NC use,
    reserve commercial to the owner). The private music repos get NO license
    deliberately — a license grants rights, and you don't grant rights on
    something you may sell; private + unlicensed = all-rights-reserved =
    maximum optionality; choose a license per product at the productization
    decision. Rejected: applying PolyForm NC to the private repos too (would
    grant NC rights that could undercut a future paid product). Detail:
    VISIBILITY.md → Licensing decisions.

21. **Repo visibility policy: novel music IP private, infra/methodology public**
    (2026-07-13, human). Disclosure is irreversible and starts patent clocks;
    private preserves optionality at ~zero cost. Music/audio devices → private
    by default (Tonality + Audiology kept public as resume showcase);
    infrastructure + the methodology → public (portfolio/credibility);
    client-confidential → private. Full policy + the actionable per-repo list:
    VISIBILITY.md. Sweep gained an opt-in `--visibility` gh check (network;
    outside the deterministic core). Corrected a prior error: harness-grader
    is PRIVATE, not public (I had conflated remote-presence with public-ness).
    Visibility changes are the human's to run (`gh repo edit … --visibility …`)
    — an access-control action, not mine.

20. **Human-epistemics methodology is a sibling project; its grounding is
    harvested here** (2026-07-13, user-approved "do both"). The user's document
    "The Applied Epistemics of AI Integration" is scaffolded as its own project
    (`ai-integration-methodology/`, rung 1) — the human-epistemic half of the
    practice, distinct from autonomous's agentic/deterministic half and carrying
    a consulting-product identity. autonomous harvested only the citable
    grounding: research/2026-07-13-human-ai-epistemics-delegate52.md (DELEGATE-52
    + a seven-mode failure taxonomy, each mapped to the doctrine it validates)
    and a new doctrine tenet "Human epistemic discipline at the gates" (the
    human's share of friction the machine can't enforce). DELEGATE-52's primary
    is flagged attributed-not-verified — booked for the next landscape audit.
    Rejected: merging the methodology into autonomous (blurs two sharp things;
    mixes a business offering into dev infrastructure).

19. **`/spinup --composite` variant adopted** (2026-07-13, user-approved).
    The composite-project pattern (umbrella repo + shared contract + N
    contract-bound module territories under a `modules_dir/`, rung 2→3 by
    default) is now canonical in ONBOARDING Part 2 and wired into the spinup
    command. It is the organ model applied intra-repo (territory = subdir, not
    a repo). First worked example: Orrery (DECISIONS there #5–9). Rejected:
    repo-per-module for composites (forces a freely-changing seam into a
    cross-repo versioned contract — see Orrery #6). Kit-v2 will formalize the
    `composite` manifest schema.

13. **Replication/onboarding instructions live in this repo (ONBOARDING.md),
    not a separate overview repo** (2026-07-10). An overview repo would have
    to describe this repo's content — duplication, hence drift — and the
    other machine's first step is already "clone autonomous"
    (INSTALL-GLOBAL.md). Rejected: separate repo; docs inside distillery/
    dispatch (they're execution tracks, not the front door). Noted
    dependency: replicating the execution tracks on another machine requires
    them to get remotes first (pending user's visibility call).
    [Resolved 2026-07-10: remotes created — github.com/Lifted-Truck/
    distillery and /dispatch, both pushed.]
14. **Ecosystem sweep/watch allowlist is canonical in `registry.json`**
    (2026-07-10, user-specified). Scope: `~/Documents/Claude` immediate
    children minus `Projects`, with `synthetic-worlds` as a GROUP (its ~16
    children are each independent projects); plus `~/Documents/Tonality`,
    `tonality-core`, `tonality-Live`, `substack2pdf`, `ableton-wrangle`.
    Rule-based (self-maintaining as folders are added), not enumerated.
    Harness/loop status is DERIVED at sweep time, never hand-maintained —
    un-normalized projects are swept-and-marked, so normalization is an
    incremental visible retrofit, never a sweep blocker. Per-consumer flags
    (dispatch `public:`) layer in consumer configs. Rejected: per-consumer
    duplicate rosters (drift) and hand-maintained status fields (stale by
    construction).
15. **First kit-v2 contracts shipped: `library-entry.1` and `status.1`, plus
    the sweep primitive** (2026-07-10, answering briefs distillery-001 and
    dispatch-001; both balls returned to consumers). Contracts live in
    `kit/contracts/` (one canonical home; loop prompts stay canonical for
    behavior); sweep lives in `kit/sweep/` (stdlib-only, tested, registry-
    driven, consumer-owned ledgers). `public:` deliberately excluded from
    STATUS — publishability is consumer policy (a project can't flag itself
    into a publication). This repo now runs its own `./verify` (fast: sweep
    tests + artifact parsing + structure; full: +live-registry smoke — 42
    projects resolve). D0/E0 manifests treated as ratified per user
    go-ahead; D1/E1 are the open fronts.
16. **Model-tier selection is human-gated, ecosystem-wide** (2026-07-11,
    user mandate). The governor/watchdog/conductor never auto-swaps model
    tiers, and automated threat-analysis / security-scanner integrations
    that can trigger provider-side model demotion are excluded from the
    stack — the user has tripped such a demotion before and escalating or
    changing models is always their explicit decision. Any candidate tool
    carrying such a component is flagged for human review, never silently
    adopted. (Context: review of the `fleet` supervisor repo — its
    mechanisms are catalogued as conductor prior art in ROADMAP; its
    multi-backend model routing would, if ever adopted, keep tier
    selection human-gated per this decision.)
17. **Interim model-routing defaults** (2026-07-11, user): top-level/lead
    agents default to the **latest Opus**; subagents default to the
    **latest Sonnet**; **Haiku** is pinned for verbatim-report and
    read-only-scout class tasks (the harness `verifier` — run the oracle,
    report verbatim, localize the failure — and the built-in Explore
    scout, which is already Haiku). Model-tier upgrades beyond these
    defaults are the user's explicit per-session call (Decision 16).
    Revisit when the user changes plan/lineup; partially resolves DESIGN
    §8 open question 5 for the interim.
18. **Clarifies 17 — Opus covers top AND mid-level agents** (2026-07-11,
    user). The dividing line is role shape, not hierarchy depth: **Opus for
    judgment-bearing roles** (lead sessions, organ leads, critic,
    coherence-critic, curator promotion judgment, distillery analyst);
    **Sonnet for scoped execution** (implementer-class: build to a brief
    with acceptance criteria); **Haiku for verbatim-fidelity/scout roles**
    (verifier, Explore). The harness trio already conforms (critic was
    always Opus); future kit-v2 profiles pin per this rule.
