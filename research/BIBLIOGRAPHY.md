# Research bibliography (dated ledger)

Running, dated record of every research pass and its primary sources. Each
pass appends a dated section; entries are one line each and link the full
report where the source is discussed. The landscape-audit loop (ROADMAP
deferred) consumes and extends this file — its per-topic "last checked" dates
live here.

**Convention:** a source appears under the date it was consulted. Re-consulting
under a later pass gets a new entry (consensus drift is the point of dating).

## 2026-07-13 — Human-AI epistemics (harvested, not web-researched)

Report: [2026-07-13-human-ai-epistemics-delegate52.md](2026-07-13-human-ai-epistemics-delegate52.md).
Source: the user's own methodology document "The Applied Epistemics of AI
Integration" (canonical in the sibling `ai-integration-methodology/` project),
NOT a web pass — so these are attributed to that document, and where it cites a
primary the primary is flagged for verification.

- DELEGATE-52 benchmark (19 models × 52 domains × 20 interactions; invisible
  failure in stronger models; ~80% of loss in sparse catastrophic collapses;
  agentic tools worsened performance ~6pts absent tight scoping) — attributed
  to "2026 Microsoft Research"; **primary URL not located / not verified in
  this harvest — landscape-audit TODO.**
- Illusion of explanatory depth (Rozenblit & Keil lineage) — via the doc.
- Attractor-basin / basin-escape account of LLM generation — the doc's own
  synthesis; mechanism-level, not a single citable paper.
- Seven-mode failure taxonomy (Consensus Trap, XY-at-scale, Competency Erosion,
  Invisible Dependency, Confidence Spiral, Translation Gap, Remediation Cliff)
  — the doc's framework.

## 2026-08-10 — Landscape audit (monthly, second run)

Report: [proposals/2026-08-10.proposal.md](proposals/2026-08-10.proposal.md).
Six fan-out agents (multi-agent coordination, agent memory, governance/
halting/safety, verification/CI-as-arbiter, context engineering/harness
design, open-scope), each scoped to "what changed since 2026-07-11." Genuine
one-month window (vs. the first pass's 1–3 days); substantial movement found.
Nearly all primary domains (arxiv.org, anthropic.com, claude.com, openai.com,
huggingface.co, aisi.gov.uk, metr.org, most security-news outlets,
web.archive.org) were network-level `EGRESS_BLOCKED` this pass — every entry

outlets per claim) unless marked otherwise; see the proposal's "Blocked /
unverified sources" section for the full accounting.
