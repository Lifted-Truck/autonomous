"""batch_leak_plant — apply kit 2.3.0's one-block leak_gate change fleet-wide.

2.3.0's retrofit action is a deterministic text insertion, not a judgment
call: the gate must ignore `.kit-currency-plant-*` unless `KIT_LEAK_PLANT`
names that exact file, so one session's currency probe cannot red another
session's concurrent `./verify` (mind-lathe, 2026-08-18; LIBRARY L0006).

Doing it by hand across the fleet is 13 identical edits, which is exactly the
shape that should not be done by hand. Constraints this script holds to:

  - ANCHORED, not fuzzy. It replaces one exact line. A repo whose gate has
    drifted is REPORTED, never guessed at (Antiphon has a variant).
  - IDEMPOTENT. A repo already carrying KIT_LEAK_PLANT is skipped.
  - PROVEN, not assumed. After patching it runs the repo's own `./verify
    fast` twice: once clean (must not newly break) and once with a foreign
    plant present (must NOT name it). A patch that does not change behaviour
    is a patch that did nothing.
  - NEVER COMMITS. Writes stay home: these are other residents' repos. The
    edit is left in the working tree for a resident or the human to commit.
  - DRY BY DEFAULT. --apply is required to write anything.
