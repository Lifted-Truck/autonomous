# fleet-sweep-async — SessionStart hook (async). Refreshes the governor's sweep
# cache in the background for the NEXT session to read.
#
# WHY THIS AND NOT launchd/cron: tried that first and it failed silently.
# macOS TCC protects ~/Documents, and a LaunchAgent does not inherit Full Disk
# Access, so `python3 monitor.py` under launchd returns "Operation not
# permitted" — exit 512 — while STATUS.md keeps whatever mtime a manual run last
# gave it. The job looks installed, the dashboard looks fresh, and nothing runs.
# That is the exact silent-success shape the governor exists to catch, so it is
# not an acceptable way to run the governor. Granting Full Disk Access to a bare
# interpreter would fix it and is a far worse trade.
#
# A Claude Code session already has access to these paths, so running the sweep
# from a session hook sidesteps TCC entirely and needs no scheduler at all.
#
# PAIRING: `fleet-brief.sh` runs synchronously and reads the cache (instant);
# this runs async and rewrites it (~4s, off the critical path). So a session
# reports the previous sweep immediately and leaves a fresh one behind. The
# freshness gap is one session, and fleet-brief prints the cache age so the gap
# is visible rather than assumed.
