"""fleet_events — the append-only event log every oversight hook writes, and the
per-gate authority every gate reads (Phase O0.5, Decision 84).

ONE central log, `~/.claude/fleet/events.jsonl`, not one per repo: these hooks
are global and run in every repo, and a per-repo log file would dirty trees that
do not ignore it. The same directory holds the O1 snapshot (Decision 77), for
the same reason: a process launchd starts cannot read `~/Documents` (Decision
42), and nothing here should need it to.

Every function is total and never raises: a hook that throws is a hook that
breaks every session. Lines carry positions and verdicts, never content.
