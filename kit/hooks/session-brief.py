"""session-brief — SessionStart hook. Tells THIS repo's session what THIS repo
owes, and nothing else.

WHY SCOPED (2026-08-17, Decision 54): the previous version read the fleet-wide
STATUS.md and reported its counts into every session on the machine, because
the hook is installed globally. Agents in several unrelated projects all warned
the human about one uncommitted brief sitting in autonomous's mailbox — a repo
none of them had standing to touch. That is a requisite-variety failure: an
attenuator must deliver a signal its recipient can ACT on, and fleet state
delivered to a leaf project is pure noise that trains the reader to skip the
channel.

Rule, and it is the same rule the protocol states for humans and agents alike:
**a repo acts only on exchanges in its own mailbox, plus responses addressed to
it elsewhere.** Everything else is somebody else's territory.

Fleet-wide roll-up appears ONLY in the standards repo, which is the one place
it is actionable.

Fail-open: an observer, not a gate.
