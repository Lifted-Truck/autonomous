"""kit_audit — the confirmation step after a kit update. Did it actually land?

Vendoring makes the question cheap, not automatic. A checksum says the BYTES
match canonical; it does not by itself say the repo still works, that nothing
else was disturbed, or that identical bytes behave identically on that machine
(a different bash, a different git, a shell option set in a project's own
verify). So this reports three independent things per repo and never collapses
them into one number:

  sync      .kit/ vs the kit — current | stale | edited | absent  (hash)
  wired     ./verify actually SOURCES the vendored gates          (reachability)
  oracle    the repo's own ./verify fast exit code                (behaviour)
  scope     working-tree changes outside .kit/ and verify        (INFORMATIONAL)

`sync` without `wired` is the old trap in a new costume: a repo can carry a
perfect, checksum-verified copy of the gate and still be completely ungated,
because its `verify` never sources it. Installing files is not installing
protection. The audit reports them separately and treats unwired as a
finding, never as a pass — three repos read `current` and SILENT on the first
fleet run for exactly this reason.

Plus a BEHAVIOURAL SAMPLE: on a few repos it runs the real plant probe and
requires the gate to fire, confirming that the checksum inference holds in the
field. The sample is the honest remnant of "assert the effective state, never
the declared state" — vendoring lets us stop probing every repo, it does not
license trusting the inference untested. Deterministic (sorted, strided), so
two runs sample the same repos and a run is reproducible.
