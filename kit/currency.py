"""currency — the deterministic half of `/retrofit`: where is this repo
against the kit, and exactly which entries does it need?

Phase K1 (Decision 51). `/retrofit` used to re-derive a repo's harness state
every run and then re-scaffold. Now it MIGRATES: read the repo's declared
`kit_version`, diff it against `kit/CHANGELOG.md`, and emit the ordered list
of entries the repo is behind — each with a presence check the retrofit can
act on. AI does the parts that need judgement (inferring survey answers,
mapping a foreign kit's substance into standard slots); THIS does the parts
that must never depend on judgement (what version, what delta, what present).

Absence is never current: a repo with no `kit_version` is `pre-2.0.0` and
gets every entry. Idempotence is the gate — a repo AT the kit version gets an
empty delta, so re-running the retrofit is a no-op by construction.

Usage:
  currency.py <repo> [--kit <autonomous>] [--json]
Exit 0 always for a readable repo (report tool). Exit 2 = repo unreadable.
