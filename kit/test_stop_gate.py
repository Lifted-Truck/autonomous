"""The closing gate's verdict table (kit 2.9.0, horde brief hypersaw-009).

The table is the contract: (name, setup, env, hook input, expected exit), where
0 lets the session stop and 2 blocks it. Every row runs the REAL vendored
`stop-gate.sh` in a scratch repository whose "verify" is the real `record`.
Ported from horde's `tools/stop_gate_check.py` (16 rows, their PR #1029) and
extended with what a content fingerprint makes exact: deletions, a reverted
edit, a default branch that is not `main`, a repo with no remote.

Three controls keep the table honest. A gate that never blocks must get every
block row wrong; a gate that always blocks must get every allow row wrong (so
the allow rows are pinned too, which is the direction a blocking gate fails
in); and the gate as it stood before 2.9.0 must get exactly the tree-state
rows wrong. A table that a broken gate can pass proves nothing.

Rows marked REVIEW came from a fresh-context review on 2026-10-10 that broke
the first version: a stale record blocked a session that had only pulled, the
gate ran from whatever directory the session was in, and five mutations of
the gate passed the table as it then stood.
