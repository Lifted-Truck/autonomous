"""kit_sync — install or check a repo's VENDORED kit files.

The distribution half of the mechanism/substance split (2026-08-18). Kit
MECHANISM (gate code, hooks) is vendored into each repo's `.kit/` and pinned
by checksum; kit SUBSTANCE (charter, ROADMAP, DECISIONS, LIBRARY) stays a
judgment-bearing retrofit. Only mechanism goes through here.

Why this exists, concretely: `leak_gate` was copied into every repo by hand
and had drifted into TEN distinct implementations, NINE of them missing the
Windows identity pattern, while every one of those repos declared a
kit_version. Copying is why. The version was a claim about a copy, and a copy
can lie — so `currency.py` had to plant identity paths inside foreign repos
and run their oracle to find out the truth, which is where today's whole
defect family came from (record clobber, plant collision, ignore-blinding).
A checksum answers the same question in microseconds and cannot collide with
anything.

  install:  kit_sync.py <repo>            writes .kit/ + .kit/MANIFEST
  check  :  kit_sync.py <repo> --check    compares hashes, writes nothing
  fleet  :  kit_sync.py --all [--check]   every repo in the registry

Never commits: these are other residents' repos, and writes stay home. The
files it writes are deterministic, so a resident's in-flight work cannot be
buried by them and they cannot be buried by it.

    checked by `currency.py` and by `kit_audit`'s `wired` column. Conflating
    three questions into one verdict is how a status stops meaning anything.
    But `current` had to stop covering the untracked case, because the word
    reads as "healthy" and an untracked `.kit/` is healthy on exactly one
    machine. A narrow check that means one thing beats a broad one that means
    several; it must simply not LIE about the thing it means.

`repo_path` above is the directory this run ACTUALLY wrote, resolved at run
time — not the one anyone intended. `.` resolves against the caller's working
directory, so a run launched from elsewhere would sync some other repo and
still report success; autonomous compares this line against its registry and
disputes a mismatch. (Residuum, 2026-08-18: a receipt read `current` while the
named repo had no `.kit/` at all, and nothing in the receipt could show why.)

```
{body.strip()}
```

Verify by re-reading, not by trusting this: `kit_sync.py <repo> --check`.

`kit_sync --notify` is READ-ONLY: it reports the state it finds and never
changes it, because a report must not change what it reports. So this state
(`{st}`) will persist until someone runs the write step. The order is:

    python3 <kit>/kit_sync.py <repo>     # WRITE: sync .kit/ + MANIFEST
    git add .kit && git commit           # your repo, your commit
    python3 <kit>/kit_sync.py <repo> --notify   # REPORT: file this receipt

Filed as-is because an accurate report of a stale tree is worth more than a
tidy one — but it is not the finished state, and autonomous will dispute it.
