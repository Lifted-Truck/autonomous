"""algedonic — the pain channel. Remote-visible fleet pain only, no model calls.

VSM's algedonic signal is a threshold alarm that leaps the hierarchy: it does
not wait for a scheduled report, it does not pass through S3's judgement, it
goes straight to S5 (the human). Amendment D (Decision 47) earns this with one
incident: a machine-identity leak sat in a PUBLIC repo for 19 days, visible to
anyone with a browser, while every local sweep pointed one directory too high.
Remote-visible pain that only local tooling can notice is pain that goes
unnoticed the moment the human isn't at the keyboard.

SCOPE, stated so it is not over-trusted: this checks ONLY what GitHub can see.
  - default-branch CI RED on any roster repo with a workflow
  - machine-identity leak in the tracked tree of any PUBLIC roster repo
Local-only pain (an untracked leak, an unpushed regression, a dead local
monitor) is explicitly out of scope; that still waits for a session hook or
the FDA-cron trade the human declined. A check that claims fleet coverage it
does not have is worse than one that states its edge.

WHY NO MODEL: doctrine keeps AI out of the path of metrics and validation. A
pain signal that depends on a model's judgement can be talked out of firing,
or fire on a hallucination. This is `git grep` and `gh api`; it cannot be
argued with and it cannot invent.

WHY NOT DEPEND ON THE LOCAL REGISTRY'S PATHS: this runs on a GitHub runner
with no roster on disk. It derives the roster from the org's repo list and
clones public repos shallowly, so it sees exactly what a stranger sees — which
is the threat model.

Exit 0 = quiet. Exit 2 = pain (the workflow turns that into a notification).
Exit 1 = the check itself failed and MUST be treated as unknown, never quiet.
