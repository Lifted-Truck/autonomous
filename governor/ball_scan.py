"""ball_scan — who owes whom, and since when.

The INTEGRATIONS protocol gives every exchange a `ball:` field so exactly one
side owns the next move. It assigns responsibility; NOTHING escalates it. Three
exchanges in one week were found only because a human happened to mention them:
distillery-002 sat 13 days past `respond-by` with named content blocked behind
it, and two mailbox writes sat untracked for ~12 days each. The field worked;
the absence of a sweep over it did not.

Deterministic, no model calls, read-only — same class as leak_scan.

THE UNIT IS THE EXCHANGE ID, NOT THE FILE. A thread's opening `brief.md` keeps
`ball: provider, status: filed` forever; the answer lands in a *sibling* file.
Per-file evaluation therefore reports every answered thread as permanently
overdue, which is worse than no check at all — a scanner that always cries wolf
is a scanner nobody reads. Files are grouped by their `id:` frontmatter and the
thread's state is taken from its most recent member.
