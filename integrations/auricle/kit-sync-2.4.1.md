kit_sync reports `current` at kit 2.4.1 for `~/Documents/Claude/synthetic-worlds/auricle`.

`repo_path` above is the directory this run ACTUALLY wrote, resolved at run
time — not the one anyone intended. `.` resolves against the caller's working
directory, so a run launched from elsewhere would sync some other repo and
still report success; autonomous compares this line against its registry and
disputes a mismatch. (Residuum, 2026-08-18: a receipt read `current` while the
named repo had no `.kit/` at all, and nothing in the receipt could show why.)

MANIFEST as written:

```
kit_version: 2.4.1
# KIT-OWNED. Written by kit_sync.py — do not hand-edit these files.
# ./verify recomputes these hashes and goes red if they disagree.

```

Verify by re-reading, not by trusting this: `kit_sync.py <repo> --check`.

**autonomous verification, 2026-08-18:** `verified` — .kit/ matches canonical at 2.4.1 (hash). The repo was re-read; this line is the resident's, the text above is the filer's.
