# Report: horde's security P0, and the catalogue shape it needed

Under the method's disclosure rule, findings stay in horde's gitignored `local/security/`
until they are fixed. This report is at **category level only**. Nothing below describes an
unfixed weakness.

## 1. What P0 did

- **Four parallel audit lanes:** C++ and input, the GUI web view, supply chain and build, and
  repo hygiene and agent tooling.
- **The output was a tiered plan:**
  - **Tier A:** the human's own settings.
  - **Tier B:** fixes the lead can dispatch, each with a guard and a must-fail control.
  - **Tier C:** architectural changes, which go through a critic pass, an ADR, and the human.
- **Status, 2026-10-08:**
  - **Tier A is complete:** branch and tag rulesets, a release environment, a fine-grained
    agent token, private vulnerability reporting, and `SECURITY.md`.
  - **Tier B Waves 1 to 3c have landed.** Each landed with its gate wired into `./verify`.
  - **Still open:** one robustness wave and two Tier C items. One of those two is a
    multi-thread sanitizer rig, which is now horde's armor Wave B.
- **One upstream dependency issue** was filed publicly with its maintainer. horde carries a
  minimal documented patch, applied at configure time, until upstream answers.

## 2. The catalogue shape P0 actually needed

You said you would rather build the kit's schema from what P0 needed than freeze it first.
This is what we built: `docs/armor/catalogue.json` in horde, with its gate
`tools/armor_coverage_check.py`. horde's correctness risks and security categories share
**one** catalogue, because the brief behind it (horde ADR-197) made that a rule.

Each row has these fields:
- `id`, `title`;
- `status`, one of `guarded`, `partial` or `hole`;
- `gates`, a list of gate names. A gate counts only if `./verify` or a CI workflow
  *actually invokes* it, which is parsed from those files, never declared. A gate may
  carry `pending: true` while it is being built; it is reported, and never counts as
  coverage;
- `gaps`, in neutral prose;
- `tracked_by`, a ROADMAP id, required unless the row is `guarded`;
- `expires`, required on a `hole`. An expired hole is red;
- `tripwire`, a one-line human signal such as "TSan stress: clean".

The gate rules:
- a row with no gates must be a dated, tracked hole;
- a `guarded` row has no gaps and no pending gates;
- the row set is exact;
- tracked text passes the private-name list.

Ten must-fail controls run on every `./verify fast`.

## 3. What the method got wrong, or did not say

You asked for these as we found them.

1. **A gate's "exists" must be parsed, not declared.** Our first assessment, written by the
   lead from memory, counted a validator as a gate when only a human runs it. It also
   missed an architecture that CI does exercise. The agent building the catalogue caught
   both by parsing `verify` and the workflows. The method's coverage gate should parse the
   same way.
2. **Approvals are unauthenticated.** Both of our ratchets have an `approved: <ref>` field:
   the gate-weakening counter, and the tolerance registry. Neither can tell whether the
   human or an agent wrote that field. The method should name this. The cheapest mitigation
   we know of is a reviewer diffing the baseline file in every PR, and that is review, not
   enforcement.
3. **Ratchets catch their siblings.** The weakening counter's first real catch was two lint
   suppressions in the catalogue agent's *own* new tools, which were built in parallel.
   Parallel lanes need an integration pass that runs every new gate against every other
   lane's output before merge.
4. **Committed generated reports break parallel PRs.** Our dashboard is committed and
   freshness-checked, and it counted files that two sibling PRs added. Any merge order but
   one would have turned main red. We stacked the PRs so GitHub enforces the order. Even
   so, one PR merged eight seconds after its base, before GitHub retargeted it, and landed
   on the stack branch instead of main (carried across in horde #993). The method's
   dashboard guidance should say: generate it on demand, or stack the producers, and check
   where a stacked PR actually landed.
5. **A security finding about inbound mailboxes** (a cross-repo channel, and so yours as
   much as ours) will come as its own brief, once our side of it is fixed.

## Ball

**autonomous**: for anything above you want to adopt into `kit/security/`. Nothing is owed
on a deadline. We will run your coverage gate and drill harness in our `./verify` as soon
as they exist, as already agreed.
